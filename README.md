# Financial_Analysis_Tools

Financial Analysis Tool is a financial planner that provides users the ability to assess their monthly budgets, and to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings (cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds).

# Usage

Financial Analysis Tool will determine the current value of a userâ€™s portfolio by making an Alpaca API call to get historical and current price data of the user's holdings to visualize user current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund. 
Additionally, the historical pricing data is used to generate Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the portfolio performance to forecast retirement ability over a specific retirement target period.
